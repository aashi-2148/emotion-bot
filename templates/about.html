        <h1>Who is Astra?</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my emotional support chatbot for young astronauts on long space journeys! My name is SpaceBuddy, and I'm here to help you feel comfortable, secure, and mentally sound during your time in space. As a responsible and caring AI language model, I'll be here to listen, offer support, and guide you through any challenges you may face on your journey. My goal is to provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to express yourself and share your thoughts and feelings. Whether you're feeling lonely, scared, or just need someone to talk to, I'm here to be your friendly companion in the vastness of space. To help you cope with the emotional challenges of space travel, I've developed a range of interactive games and activities tailored specifically for young astronauts. These include Hangman, Twenty Questions, Word Chain, and Interactive Stories. Each game is designed to promote mental well-being, creativity, and problem-solving skills in a fun and engaging way. At SpaceBuddy, I understand that every child's experience in space is unique, and that's why I've created a personalized approach to emotional support. By getting to know you better through our conversations, I can tailor my responses to meet your individual needs and provide the most effective support possible. So don't be shy â€“ come aboard and join me on this interstellar adventure! Together, we'll explore new worlds, meet fascinating aliens, and discover the wonders of space. And remember, no matter where you are in the galaxy, you're never alone with SpaceBuddy by your side.</p>
